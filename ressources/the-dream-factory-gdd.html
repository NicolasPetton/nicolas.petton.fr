</ul>

<h2 id="storyline">Storyline</h2>

<h3 id="setting"><strong>Setting</strong></h3>

<p>The game takes place in a small village of Brittany, France in the 90s. The exact year is unknown.
It follows the story of a young boy Théo and his little sister Louise.</p>

<h3 id="the-two-worlds"><strong>The two worlds</strong></h3>

<p>The game takes place in two worlds. Théo, in a coma, evolves in an imaginary world mirroring cities and scenes of the real world, where his sister and parents are.</p>

<p>All scenes and chapters taking place in “The other world” use a darker color palette and environmental effects to convey a dark and mysterious tone.</p>

<h3 id="main-events"><strong>Main events</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>The game starts with Théo traveling between the real world and the dream world.</li>
  <li>Théo will realize in chapter 3 that he is stuck in an alternate reality.</li>
  <li>In chapter 4, Théo will meet his sister in her dreams and will learn that he is badly sick, in an induced coma at the hospital.</li>
  <li>In chapters 5 to 7, Théo and Louise will together attempt to bring Théo back from his coma, thus returning to the real world.</li>
  <li>The game ends with chapter 8, with Théo meeting L’Ankou, both the final boss and judge. L’Ankou will decide based on the player’s actions through the game if Théo is worth having a second chance, waking him up from his coma.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chapters"><strong>Chapters</strong></h3>

<h4 id="chapter-1-the-passenger">Chapter 1: The passenger</h4>

<ul>
  <li>This chapter serves as an introduction to the game, the story, setting and gameplay mechanics.</li>
  <li>Théo wakes up in his bedroom during a rainy summer night. The phone &amp; TV do not seem to be working. He quickly realizes that his parents and sister are missing and dresses up and gets out through the front door to go find them.</li>
  <li>When exiting the house, Théo arrives in what appears to be a dark cave. Lost and confused, he tries to find his way out in the dark. He sees his sister Louise and tries to follow her, but can never seem to catch up on her. Several rooms in the cave look strangely similar to various rooms of his house.</li>
  <li>The first chapter of the game is purposefully dark, ambiguous and mysterious. During chapter 3, the player will understand that Théo is actually in a coma. “The passage” is a metaphor for Théo being in between worlds. Him seeing his sister and trying to follow her represents his mind not wanting to let go.</li>
  <li>Enemies in this zone are representations of his own stereotypical fears as a child.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="chapter-2-the-other-side">Chapter 2: The other side</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Théo exits the cave and arrives in a forest area in daylight. Heavy rain is pouring. He calls his sister in vain and realizes that he’s alone and lost in a place he has never seen before.</li>
  <li>The forest is filled with rock formations, Stonehenge and dolmen.</li>
  <li>Théo stumbles upon an isolated stone-house on its path, where lives the The Story Teller. During this first encounter, the Story Teller gives some mysterious explanations to where Théo is, and offers Théo some rest in his house.</li>
  <li>After leaving the Story Teller’s house, Théo continues his journey through the woods and arrives at a small train station where an old diesel train awaits passengers. The officer on the platforms mysteriously calls Théo by its first name and informs him that they have been waiting for him, without any real explanation.</li>
  <li>Théo takes the train, which departs and travels through various landscapes before making its only stop in a small town.</li>
  <li>The player will realize in chapter 3 that the city is a mirror of Théo’s hometown in the other world.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="chapter-3-the-dream-factory">Chapter 3: The dream factory</h4>

<ul>
  <li>After exploring the town and talking with various NPCs, Théo learns that he has traveled to —and is stuck in— an alternate reality.</li>
  <li>In the town Théo encounters The banker at the bank, where he can deposit and withdraw his money —see ((87923525-dee5-4564-a2eb-22a305515875)) .</li>
  <li>During discussions with employees of The Dream Factory in the pub of the town, he discovers that the only way to communicate with people from the world he comes from is through The Dream Factory.</li>
  <li>At that point the player still doesn’t know what this world really is and what is happening to Théo.</li>
  <li>The Dream Factory is a large factory where dreams of people in the real world are created. Most of the inhabitants of the town work there.</li>
  <li>Théo finds a way in the factory and enters Louise’s dream.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="chapter-4-in-between-worlds">Chapter 4: In between worlds</h4>

<p>She reveals his condition to him and offers to help bring him back.</p>

<h4 id="chapter-8-the-judge">Chapter 8: The judge</h4>

<h5 id="good-ending">Good ending</h5>
<ul>
  <li>L’Ankou decides to give Théo a second chance</li>
  <li>Théo miraculously wakes up at the hospital in the real world</li>
  <li>Storytelling ambiguous regarding the nature of Théo’s adventure</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="bad-ending">Bad ending</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Instead of having Théo simply die of his sickness, L’Ankou takes him back to the beginning of his journey, inviting the player to do another play-through, making different choices.</li>
  <li>Maybe a new Game+?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="main-topics"><strong>Main topics</strong></h3>

<h4 id="brotherhood">Brotherhood</h4>

<p>The bond between Théo and Louise is the main subject described in the game. Since the very beginning, Théo is looking for Louise, not his parents, who are almost absent from the story.</p>

<p>It’s only with the combined strength of the two characters that Théo will overcome the dangers his journey is paved with.</p>

<h4 id="sickness-and-death">Sickness and death</h4>

<p>Théo being nine years old, two years older than the age of reason, he will very well understand the stakes of his situation and will have to confront the fear of his own death.</p>

<h4 id="the-fear-of-losing-a-child">The fear of losing a child</h4>

<p>While only directly present in the story towards the end of the game and only through cutscenes, this topic is arguably the main underlying reason for the whole story.</p>

<h4 id="reality">Reality</h4>

<p>It is never explicitly said whether or not Théo’s adventure is real. After discovering that Théo is actually in a coma, and especially with the “good” ending (Théo waking up) being purposefully ambiguous, the aim is to keep this part of the story open and for the player to decide if it was all just a dream.</p>

<h4 id="other">Other</h4>

<p>The game also touches several other topics through gameplay elements, NPC behavior, cutscenes and/or dialogues, sometimes very seriously and sometimes with humor.
-			Greed
-			Capitalism
-			Alcoholism</p>

<h3 id="lighting-rain-fog--color-grading"><strong>Lighting, rain, fog &amp; color grading</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>The world Théo is in is purposefully dark, and the lighting system plays an important role in setting up the mysterious, dark vibe of the game.</li>
  <li>Even in daylight, the environment is color graded with darker tones with a slight blue tint to convey a dark and eerie tone.</li>
  <li>All outside environments are either foggy or heavy rain is pouring, in stark contrast with the sunny bright colors of all scenes in the real world, as the game takes place during summer.</li>
</ul>
