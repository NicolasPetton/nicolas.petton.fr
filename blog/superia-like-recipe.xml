    <p>
    Ever since I stumbled upon the work of Ritchie on <a href="https://fujixweekly.com">Fuji X Weekly</a> and his film
    simulation recipes, I've tried to set up my camera with various recipes and
    shoot jpeg only.
    </p>

    <p>
    I found shooting jpeg quite liberating.  I used to expose for highlights,
    sometimes shoot wider than necessary, thinking that I would figure that out
    later in post, knowing that my raw files have all the data I needed.  In the end
    I spent more time editing raw files -- with the trustworthy <a href="https://www.darktable.org">Darktable</a> -- than
    actually shooting. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Editing raw files can be very, very time consuming.  To the point that I decided
    to only edit my best photographs.
    </p>

    <p>
    I've realized that if I had to get everything right in camera, I would be forced
    to be more present when shooting, be more aware of the composition, colors and
    light, instead of delaying the creative part to later.
    </p>

    <p>
    So I "loaded" a few film recipes that I liked: <a href="https://fujixweekly.com/2020/05/27/my-fujifilm-x100v-kodachrome-64-film-simulation-recipe/">Kodachrome 64</a>, <a href="https://fujixweekly.com/2020/06/10/fujifilm-x100v-film-simulation-kodak-portra-400/">Portra 400</a> and
    <a href="https://fujixweekly.com/2020/07/27/fujifilm-x100v-film-simulation-recipe-fujicolor-superia-800/">Superia 800</a>, and went shooting jpeg-only for a few days.
    </p>

    <div id="outline-container-orgead29e3" class="outline-3">
    <h3 id="orgead29e3">Superia</h3>
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgead29e3">
    <p>
    While I really liked the aesthetics of both Kodachrome and Portra 400, I couldn't
    resist the amazing look of the new Classic Neg film simulation, and the various
    Superia recipes Ritchie has made on top of it.  They're truly excellent.
    </p>

    <p>
    I decided to search for a Superia-like feel (not necessarily one exact film).
    </p>

    <p>
    I live in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany">a part of the world</a> where the sky is often overcast&#x2026; when rain is
    not pouring.  <a href="https://fujixweekly.com/2020/07/27/fujifilm-x100v-film-simulation-recipe-fujicolor-superia-800/">Superia 800</a> is great in many situations, but it really shines in
    dreary days.
    </p>

    <p>
    I found however that it is not very good for skin tones, as there's a quite
    strong yellowish or green cast to it, resulting in unnatural skin tone
    rendition.  I then moved on to another Superia recipe from Ritchie: <a href="https://fujixweekly.com/2020/06/29/fujifilm-x100v-film-simulation-recipe-fujicolor-superia-1600/">Superia
    1600</a>, which is nothing short of amazing.
    </p>

    <p>
    Superia 1600 has more contrast, but less color saturation. The white balance
    tint gives very pleasing skin tones, and it has this unmistakable Superia look.
    </p>

    <p>
    I found it a bit too desaturated for my taste, though it can be used to great
    effect. I also found the grain to be too much.  Since I didn't really tried to
    emulate a specific Superia film, but rather to get a good general use
    Superia-like recipe, I ended up tweaking the Superia 1600 recipe to my likings,
    making it a tad richer in color, and less grainy.
    </p>

    <p>
    I found that richer colors make the white balance shift more visible, especially
    on reds, browns and skin tones, which I like a lot.
    </p>

    <ul class="org-ul">
    <li>Classic Negative</li>
    <li>Dynamic Range: DR400</li>
    <li>Highlight: 0</li>
    <li>Shadow: +2</li>
    <li>Color: -1</li>
    <li>Noise Reduction: -4</li>
    <li>Sharpening: -1</li>
    <li>Clarity: -4</li>
    <li>Grain Effect: Weak, Small</li>
    <li>Color Chrome Effect: Strong</li>
    <li>Color Chrome Effect Blue: Strong</li>
    <li>White Balance: Daylight, +3 Red &amp; +1 Blue</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div id="outline-container-orge78308d" class="outline-3">
    <h3 id="orge78308d">Sample images</h3>
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge78308d">
    <p>
    Here are some photographs I took with the above recipe, straight out of camera.
